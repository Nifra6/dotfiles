|------|--------|----------|
| Distribution | Arch | love it or hate it, I love i |
| Tile Manager | sway (moving to Hyprland WIP) | Yeah does not support nvidia (**** nvidia, like he said) but really good tile managing and way more welcoming than i3 imo |
| Statusbar | waybar | Just perfect |
| Shell | zsh (without oh-my-zsh) | because it's better than bash, obviously; and for fish, I prefer the feal of zsh for now |
| File Manager | CLI : ranger / GUI : nemo | ranger is pretty damn good, nemo when I want to have a GUI |
| Terminal Emulator | kitty | tiling and tabs included, pretty powerfull |
| IDE | vscode (moving to neovim WIP) | I know, I'm working on my nvim config atm. But pretty good IDE nonetheless with simple and powerfull costumization |

| Distribution | Ubuntu 22.04 | ... yeah I'm not a big fan of apt/snap combo, since apt repo ... are pretty outdated imo |
| Desktop Environment | Regolith (i3 as TM) | At least not the gnome thing, i3 and not sway to be sure to not have issues with the GPU |
| File Manager | the gnome thing | ... it works. Nothing to say |


# That's everything folks
