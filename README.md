# My dotfiles

## What can you expect

Bad casual english and some french in dotfiles. Bc I'm french, yup.

## What I use to save my dotfiles

`chezmoi`


## What I use on my setup
- Distrib : Arch, love it or hate it, I love it
- Tile manager : sway, just perfect. Yeah does not support nvidia (**** nvidia, like he said) but really good tile managing and way more welcoming than i3 imo. Btw I use waybar with sway
- Shell : zsh, because it's better than bash, obviously, and I never take the time to really test if fish was more adapted to me (I prefer the feal of zsh for now)
- file explorator : ranger is pretty damn good, nemo when I want to have a GUI
- Terminal emulator : kitty, because it's what I have been introduced with to Arch, never try anything else
- IDE : vscode, I know, I'm working on my nvim config atm. But pretty good IDE nonetheless with simple and powerfull costumization


## What I accomodate with at work
- Distrib : Ubuntu 22.04 ... yeah I'm not a big fan of apt/snap combo, since apt repo ... are pretty outdated imo
- Windows manager :( : Gnome mate thingy idk ........ I just accomodate
- Te : gnome-terminal, I really need to trash it
- GUI file explorator : the gnome thing. it works. Nothing to say

# That's everything folks

Yeah maybe this readme will be updated, but ... yeah that's pretty just from my usage so :shrug:

À plus dans le bus !
